# StreamerEventViewer (SEV)

## Specifications

0. You are required to build an application which exposes two simple pages to the browser

1. The first/home page lets a user login with Twitch and set their favorite Twitch streamer name. This initiates a backend event
   listener which listens to all events for given streamer.

2. The second/streamer page shows an embedded livestream, chat and list of 10 most recent events for your favorite streamer. This page
   doesnâ€™t poll the backend and rather leverages web sockets and relevant Twitch API.

3. Additionally please answer following questions at the bottom of your `README`:
- How would you deploy the above on AWS? (ideally a rough architecture diagram will help)
- Where do you see bottlenecks in your proposed architecture and how would you approach scaling this app starting from 100 reqs/day to
   900MM reqs/day over 6 months?

> Goodluck! And please feel free to ping us if you have any questions. We looking forward to having you on-board our team :)
